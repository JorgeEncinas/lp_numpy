# Deep Learning Prerequisites: The NumPy Stack in Python.
Following "Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python" by the Lazy Programmer.
I intend to follow and get practice using these common tools.

I actually want to do a course on Hidden Markov Models by the Lazy Programmer, and he heavily emphasizes the importance of the prerequisites so you can follow along.
It's a short and important course, so I might as well!
